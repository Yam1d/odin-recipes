		<div id = "ingredients">
			<p>You will need:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1lb of Organic Strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
				<li>1 tbsp of Raw Honey</li>
				<li>2 tbsp of Lemon Juice</li>
				<li>2 cups of Whipped Cream (alternatively you can use coconut whipped cream)</li>

		</div>

			<p>Here are the steps to make this recipe</p>
			<ol>
				<lI>If using fresh strawberries, wash,hull and slice the berries and place them in a bowl. If using frozen strawberries, simply dump them into a bowl and move onto the next step. Pour the hone and fresh lemon juice over the strawberries , stir well, and let the strawberries sit on the counter to draw out the juices</lI>
				<li>If you're going to be gone a few hours while they're macerating, stick them in the fridge until you're back. And if you're working with frozen strawberries, leave them on the counter so they can come up to room temperature before making the parfaits.</li>
				<li>When everything is ready, break the scones up into chunks and then layer each ingredient (scones, strawberries, lemon curd and whipped cream) into the parfait glass until filled up. If desired pour some of the juices that accumulate from the strawberries onto the scones as you build up each layer</li>
				<li>Top with a strawberry (if you have any left over) and enjoy! These should last a few days in the fridge if you want to make them ahead of time, although the texture of the scone may soften considerably</li>
			</ol>
